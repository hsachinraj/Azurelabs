## Working with Jenkins

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a very popular Java based, open source continuous integration server that allows teams to continuously build applications across platforms.

Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS) includes Team Build,a native CI build server that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac and allows building any application on these platform. However, it also integrates well with Jenkins for teams who prefer to use Jenkins for CI. 

This lab shows how you can integrate Team Servcies and Jenkins. In this lab, we will see how you can
 * Provision Jenkins on Azure with a Azure Marketplace Template VM
 * Setup a Jenkins build
 * Configure Team Services to trigger Jenkins upon code change
 * Setup Release Management in VSTS to deploy artifacts from Jenkins

## Pre-requisites
1. Microsoft Azure Account:</b> You will need a valid and active azure account for the labs.

1.  You need a <b>Visual Studio Team Services Account</b> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2gBL4r4">Personal Access Token</a>

1. You will need [Putty](http://www.putty.org/), a free SSH and Telnet client

## Setting up the project

1. Use <a href="https://vstsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank">VSTS Demo Data Generator</a> to provision a project on your VSTS account 

 2. Select **MyShuttleJenkins** for the template


## Setting up Jenkins VM
1. Let's set up Jenkins. We will use the VM image available on Azure MarketPlace that will install the latest stable Jenkins version on a Ubuntu Linux VM along with tools and plugins configured to work with Azure

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/azure-oss.jenkinsjenkins" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>
 
1. Once the machine is provisioned, click **Connect** and note down the \<username> and \<ip address>. We will need this to connect to the VM from ***Putty***

    ![SSH Connection Info](images/vmconnect_ssh1.png)

1. You will notice that by default the instance listens on port 8080 using HTTP. If you want to set up HTTPS communication, you will need to provide an SSL certificate. If you do not setup HTTPS communication, the best way to make sure the sign-in credentials are not leaked due to a "Man-in-the-middle" attack is to only log in using SSH tunneling. An SSH tunnel is an encrypted tunnel created through an SSH protocol connection, which can be used to transfer unencrypted traffic over an unsecured network. Simply run this command
    ````
    putty.exe -ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 \<username>@\<ip address>
    ````
    ![Connecting from Putty](images/ssh2.png)

1. Login with the user name and password that you provided when you provisioned the VM.

1. Once you are connected successfully, open a browser and type [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

1. You will need to provide the initial admin password that Jenkins generates and saves it in a file on the server. 
    ![Jenkins Initial Password](images/jenkinsinitialpwd.png)

1. Return to the **Putty** terminal password and type the following command to open the file that has the initial admin password. Copy the text
    >sudo nano /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

    *You can press **Ctrl+K** to cut the text and place it in the clipboard. Press **F2** to exit the nano editor*

1. Back in the browser, paste the text and select **Continue**
    ![Unlock Jenkins - First Time](images/Jenkinsinitialpwd.png)

    Next you need to choose the plug-ins to install. Jenkins has a large ecosystem with a strong and active open source community users contributing several hundreds of useful plugins. When you setup Jenkins, you can start with installing the most commonly used plugins or select and install the ones that you want.

1. You will need the Maven plug-in which is not installed by default but we will do it later. For now, we will go with the suggested plugins. Select **Install suggested plugin**

    ![Customize Jenkins Plugins](images/customizejenkins-plugins.png)
    
1. You will need to create a new *Admin* user for Jenkins. Provide a user name and password and select **Continue**

    ![Create Admin User for Jenkins](images/firstadminuser.png)

1. Now, you have Jenkins ready to use. Select **Start using Jenkins**

    ![Jenkins Ready](images/jenkinsready.png)

## Installing and configuring Maven

 Starting from Jenkins version 2, Maven plugin is not installed by default.  You will need to do this manually

1. Select **Manage Jenkins** on the main page of the Jenkins portal.  This will take you to the Manage Jenkins page, the central one-stop-shop for all your Jenkins configuration. From this screen, you can configure your Jenkins server, install and upgrade plugins, keep track of system load, manage distributed build servers, and more! 

1. Select **Manage Plugins** 

    ![Manage Jenkins](images/manage-jenkins1.png)

1.  Select **Available** tab and search **maven-plugin** in the filter box

1. Check **Maven Integration Plugin** and selct **Install without restart** to install the plugin. Wait for the plug-in to be installed.

    ![Install Maven](images/installmavenplugin.png)

1. Select **Manage Jenkins** and select **Global Tool Configuration**

    ![Global Tool Configuration](images/manage-tools-config.png)

1.  You have added the Maven plugin for Jenkins but you have not installed Maven on the machine. Jenkins provides great out-of-the-box support for Maven.  You could  manually install Maven by extracting the ***tar*** file located in a shared folder. Alternatively, you can let Jenkins do all the hardwork and download Maven for you. Select the **Install automatically** checkbox. Jenkins will download and install Maven from the Apache website the first time a build job needs it. 

    We will install version 3.5, the latest version at the time the lab is written

    ![Maven Installer](images/maveninstallerconfig.png)

1. Click **Apply** and select **Back to Dashboard** to return to the home page. 

## Creating a new Build Job

1. From Jenkins home page, select **New Item**. Enter a name for the build definition, and select **Maven project**. Click **OK** to save 
    ![](images/newbuilddef.png)

 1. Scroll down to the **Source code Management** section. Select **Git** and Enter the clone URL of your VSTS Git repo. It should be in http://<your account name>.visualstudio.com/<your project name>/_git/MyShuttle

    ![Configuring VSTS Git URL](images/jenkins-vstsrepo.png)

    **Note:** VSTS Git repos are private. So you will need to provide the credentials to access the repository. If you have not set the Git crednetials, you can do it from VSTS
    ![Generating Git Credentials](images/vsts-generategitcreds.png)
    
1. Select **Add | Jenkins** to add a new credential. Save the user name and password and click **Add** to close the wizard
    ![Adding Credentials to Jenkins](images/jenkinscredentials.png)

1. Select the credential from the drop-down. The error message should disappear now 
    ![VSTS Git config in Jenkins](images/jenksaddvstsgit.png)

1. The source code for this application has both unit tests and UI tests. We will include the unit tests but skip the UI tests from running now.

1. Scroll down to the **Build Settings** section. Enter the following text in the **Goals and Options** field

    >package -Dtest=FaresTest,SimpleTest

1. Click **Save** to naviagate to the main page of the project you just created
    ![Build Settings in Jenkins](images/jenkins-buildsettings.png)

1. The last configuration that we will do for this lab is to add a *Post-build* action to publish the artifacts. Scroll down to **Post-Build Actions**  section, click **Add post-build action** and select **Archieve the artifacts**
    ![Post Build Action](images/jenkinspostbuildaction.png)

1. Enter  **target/*.war** in the text box. Click **Save** to save the settings and return to the project page
    ![Archive War](images/jenkinsarchiveartifacts.png)

1. We have completed all the necessary configuration and Select **Build Now** to start an Ad-hoc build

1. You will notice the build progress just below the left side navigation menu
    ![Running Ad-hoc Build](images/adhocbuild.png)

1. You can select the build number to get into the details of the build including the build artifacts, in this case, the WAR file for the project.
    ![Build Details](images/builddetails.png)
    ![Build Artifacts](images/buildmodules.png)

1. Select the **Test Results** links if you want to see the results of the unit tests that were included in the build defintion. 

## Configuring the build as Continuous Integration

In this section, let's see how you can configure a code change in VSTS to trigger a build in Jenkins

1. Go to your VSTS project page and navigate to the admin  **Service Hooks** page

    ![Navigate to service hooks page](images/servicehooks.png)

1. Select **Create subscription** button

1. In the *New subscriptions dialog* select **Jenkins** and click **Next**
    ![Create a new subscription](images/vsts-createjenkinsservice.png)

1. Select **Code pushed**  for the **Trigger on this of type event**

1. Make sure you have selected the **MyShuttle** (or the correct repo) for which you have configured the build

1. Select **Next**

    ![VSTS - Trigger Code Pushed](images/vsts-jenkinssubscription1.png)

1. In the next page, select **Trigger generic build** for the perform action field

1. Enter the URL of the Jenkins server in **http://ipaddress or domainname format

1. Enter **User name** and **Password** that you have setup for Jenkis

1. Select **Test** to check the settings. If the settings are correct, click **Finish** to save and exit
    
    ![VSTS - Jenkins Info](images/vsts-jenkinssubscription2.png)

Now you can try making a change and commit your code. Upon commit, VSTS will notify Jenkins to initiate a new build/


## Deploying Jenkins Artifacts with Release Management

You can Visual Studio Team Services Release Management to fetch the artifacts from the Jenkins server and deploy them. In this exercise below, we will configure VSTS to deploy the WAR file to Azure Web App Service. 

1. First, you will need to create an endpoint to Azure and the Jenkis server. From the **Admin | Services** tab, select the **New Service Endpoint | Jenkins** button to create a new endpoint

2. Provide the server URL and the user name and password (the credentials you provided for the first admin user). The server URL is in http://[server IP address or DNS name] format. Click **Verify Copnnection** to validate the entries and to confirm that VSTS is able to reach the Jenkins server
    ![Jenkins Endpoint](images/jenkinsendpoint.png)

    You are now ready to create a new release definition. 

1. Select the **Build & Release** hub and select **+ Create a new Release defintion** to start creating a new release definition

1. We will use the **Azure App Service Deployment** template as we are trying to publish a web application
    ![New Release Defintion](images/newreleasedefintion.png)

1. We will name the default environment as **Dev**
    ![New Environment](images/rm_environment.png)

1. We will link this relase definition to the MyShuttle build on Jenkins. Select **+Add** to add an artifact

1. Select **Jenkins** for the *Source type*. Select the Jenkins endpoint you created above and enter **MyShuttle** for the *Source(Job)* - Note this should map to the project name that you have configured in Jenkins

1. If you have configured Jenkins server and the source corectly, you will get a message showing the output of the build, in this case it should be ***myshuttledev.war***
    ![Add Jenkins artifact](images/rm_addjenkinsartifact.png)

1. You are now ready to deploy!

1. You can refer to the [Deploying Tomcat+MySQL application to Azure with VSTS]() if you want to continue with the deployment.
